      <h1>Hi, I'm Sanzida — nice to meet you!</h1>
      <p>
  I’m a recent graduate of Hunter College, where I majored in Emerging Media and minored in Psychology.
  My academic background has given me a unique blend of creative design thinking and an understanding
  of human behavior — which naturally led me to pursue an interest in UI/UX design. I’m fascinated by how
  thoughtful design can make digital experiences more intuitive, accessible, and even joyful. Whether it’s
  prototyping interfaces or analyzing user flows, I’m driven by a passion to build experiences that not
  only look good but feel right. My goal is to create design solutions that are empathetic, inclusive,
  and rooted in real user needs.
